Plutonem ( Latin style of Pluto ) create a global E-Commerce Platform, where users could buy products with more simulation shopping experience. For example, users decide to buy the product through watching a short product introduction video or AR function that shows exactly what the product looks like.

We are looking forward for you to join us creating this platform together, although we create this repository not for open source, we hope that we can meet the right partner to build a great company together.

# What we are looking for

We are now focusing on improving the customers online shopping experience by giving them more simulation shopping scene.

1. Do it with short video

As you probably know tiktok has about billion users all around the world, people love to see high quality short video because they are fun and real. We hope we could help the sellers to upload fantastic videos to describe their products, making users decide whether it fits them easily.

2. Do it with augmented reality

This topic has been around for two to three years, but we still think today's technology with augmented reality still has long way to go. We want the users could see their wishing-things right in front of their faces and they can use their finger to move, flip, do anything they want with this virtual product so they could know everything detailed about this product. We think this gonna be magical. We really hope someone in the world that enthusiam about augmented reality could join us to create this shopping experience.

# Last wish

Thanks again guys for all of the hard work you do by now and wish we could go further and stronger.
